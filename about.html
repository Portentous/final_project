    <h2 align="center">About the Game</h2>
    <p>Far Cry 4 is an open-world game that takes place in a semi-fictional land called Kyrat.  The land is ruled by a crazy dictator named Pagan Min, and he has been supressing the people of Kyrat for years.  His taking over of the region has led to a group of rebels arising called the Golden Path.  These rebels are dedicated to restoring Kyrat back to the times before Pagan.  </p>
    <p>You are Ajay Ghale, son of Mohan Ghale, and have returned to Kyrat from America to spread your mothers ashes at lakshmana.  You father Mohan, was the leader of the Golden Path and started the revolution against Pagan Min.  Your father was killed in the revolution and your mother, Ishwari, fled with you to America.  Now that she has passed, you return to Kyrat to fulfill her last wishes and you find yourself in the middle of a war.  You are rescued from Pagan by the Golden Path and are brought into their fold to help take down Pagan's Empire.  </p>
    <p>The game allows you to explore an expansive open world with so many things to do.  You can hunt animals for skins to upgrade your bags for loot, ammo, holsters etc.  You can harvest plants to make syringes to heal you and increase your abilities.  Explore the island on foot, driving a variety of vehicles, or in a small gyrocopter.  Attack and defend outposts, or race around the island in racing missions.  </p>
